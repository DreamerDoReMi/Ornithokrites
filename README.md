Technology:
Python, numerically intensive parts in C/C++.

Deployment:
Amazon Web Services, EC2 instance of Ubuntu. In principle it can be installed on any operating system, though Unix-like confer least effort. At the end it should act as a web service that, provided input data, generates a report and sends it to a user.
